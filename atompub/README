HOW TO USE THE LIBRARY

Most of the files here are for testing. All you need to generate Atom feeds is
the atom.py file. For instructions on how to use this module to generate Atom
feeds, see http://code.google.com/p/django-atompub/wiki/UserGuide


HOW TO RUN FEED GENERATOR TESTS

You'll need to create the database with 

    python manage.py syncdb

and then add the test fixtures with

    python manage.py loaddata test1

You can then start the server with

    python manage.py runserver

and hit

    http://localhost:8000/feeds/test_1/
    http://localhost:8000/feeds/test_2/
    http://localhost:8000/feeds/test_3/
    http://localhost:8000/feeds/test_4/


HOW TO RUN VALIDATION UNIT TESTS

Just run

    python test_validation.py
